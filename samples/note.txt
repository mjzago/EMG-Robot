Note that the wavelet coefficients represent a downsampling of the original data. The features are calculated over windows of coefficients and thus represent another downsampling operation. Despite that, the first 100 lines of each file were kept. 

These were the original line counts in each file:

original:     253355
orientation:  253355
cD2:          128327
cD2 features:   3378
cD1:          253276
cD1 features:   3378
cA2:          128327
cA2 featuers:   3378
